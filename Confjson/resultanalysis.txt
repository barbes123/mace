1 detector:
increase-worked
increase and decrease-worked

+1 value for trigger delay for call and email(insignificant latency)
1 detector test passed.


6detector:
first test:
1 email missing
2 calls missing
2 sd missing
0 filling missing
0 sd missing
1 call missing
all emails missing

second test: (removing time from alarming functions)
removed time made influxdb server not record all the alarms, although there is just one missing email alarm
the others were triggered but not recorded.
adding small time instead of one second.

third test:(with settings mentioned)
improvements but still poor quality.
increasing time between read-outs.

fourth test:(with settings mentioned)
better quality.
increasing read-out time and influxdb time

fifth test:
read-out time permitted all alarms to trigger but not enough time for the influxdb

sixth test:
almost perfect detection.
increasing time

seventh test:
removing powerup function that was used before for testing as it messes up the timing
decreasing a little read-out time

eigth test:
found issues with thread timing. fixing and reducing read-out time.

nineth test:
1 alarm missing from each email triggers. substantial progress.
increasing read-out

tenth test:
read-out is not the problem. syncing threads.
problem with testing data.
reducing read-out for better performance.

code is reading well
input data was the problem

8 detector test passed.

found problem filling is getting triggered for no alarm
